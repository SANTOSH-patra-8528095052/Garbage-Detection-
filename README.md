The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters in training a neural network. Here's how it affects accuracy:

1. Low Learning Rate (e.g., 0.0001 or lower)
Effect: The model learns very slowly, resulting in a long training time.
Accuracy: It may eventually achieve high accuracy, but it can get stuck in local minima.
Solution: Gradually increase the learning rate using techniques like learning rate schedules or adaptive learning rates (e.g., Adam optimizer).
2. Moderate Learning Rate (e.g., 0.001)
Effect: A balanced learning rate typically leads to stable and efficient training.
Accuracy: Achieves good accuracy with reasonable training time.
Solution: This is usually a good starting point. Try using a range around it for experimentation.
3. High Learning Rate (e.g., 0.01 or higher)
Effect: The model learns too quickly, often overshooting the optimal solution.
Accuracy: Accuracy fluctuates or may not improve.
Solution: Reduce the learning rate or implement techniques like learning rate decay.
